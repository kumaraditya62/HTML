      The Union Public Service Commissionâ€™s exam format is being used as a model
      by many state commissions for their syllabi and/or exams. As a result,
      candidates who intend to sit for the Bihar Public Service Commission exam
      should coordinate their BPSC preparation with their UPSC IAS Exam
      preparation. The main difference between studying for the UPSC exam and
      the BPSC exam is that in the latter, applicants must become aware of the
      state of Bihar, including its history, geography, politics, and current
      affairs.Similar to the IAS exam, which is conducted by the Union Public
      Service Commission (UPSC), the BPSC exam comprises three stages: Prelims,
      Mains and Interview. In this article, we have given in detail the History
      of Bihar: Ancient, Medieval and Modern to help the candidates prepare for
      their exams.
